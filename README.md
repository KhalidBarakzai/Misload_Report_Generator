# Misload_Report_Generator
June, 2023

This script serves the purpose of generating a package misload report. It achieves this by executing the following tasks:
Extracting two specific columns of data from an Excel sheet and constructing a name-route ID map. This map associates Loaders with multiple route IDs.
Extracting a targeted column of data from another Excel sheet, specifically focusing on misloads.
For each occurrence of a misload associated with a Route ID, a counter is toggled to accurately capture and tally the misloads assigned to the corresponding loader.
Ultimately, the script generates a professional-looking Word document, which is saved in a designated folder named "Misload Reports".
This program has been meticulously crafted to serve as an indispensable tool for a Full-Time Preload Supervisor.
